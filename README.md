# EDIDMaker

EDIDMaker is simple tool that generates EDID data. It was designed to generate the EDID data for PhantomCap, but it can also be used for other purposes.

## Howto

```sh
make
./edidmaker
```

And then, sit back and enjoy your freshly made `edid.bin`. You can currently tweak the EDID in main.cpp. In the future we'll have something cleaner to do this !
